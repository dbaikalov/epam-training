You play a twisted little game
But I know in a way
You need to complicate
Believe that though we never eat
We still know how to feed
We still know how to bleed, oh
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
My arms keep you in the room
Barely let you move
Show me what you do, oh
Tonight we're second-guessed again
Let me wrap the chains
Addicted to the pain, oh
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
